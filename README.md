# Breast Cancer Dataset Analysis

### **What is the purpose of this work?**

<br>
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook in which I am going to perform an analysis of the Breast cancer dataset, and then apply machine learning models, K Folds, Grid Search, among other methods, and thus comparing their results and which one fits better.
<br>
<br>

This repository, has as a personal goal to familiarize myself with machine learning techniques
, and to help disseminate what I have learned regarding the same topic.

In addition, what one should take away after reading this paper is the following:

-   Familiarize oneself with the models.
-   Familiarize yourself with hyper-parameters and machine learning models
-   Learning how to build machine learning models
-   A well-formed foundation of the tools, such as Scikit-Learn, Pandas, MatplotLib, Seaborn, among others

## Description:
---
The Notebook will have the following structure in the form of **steps**.


## Steps:

1. Visualize data, view summations.
2. Divide between training and test
3. Training a simple model (KNN)
4. View performance metrics
5. Normalize features - do you get better at doing that?
6. Optimize hyperparameters - how much does it improve?
7. Apply more complex models how much better does it get with more complex models?
8. Modify hyper-parameter optimization and use K-Folds
9. Training of the final model

**Python 3.7 required**

Use the package manager [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/install.html) to install the same virtual environment that I used, this command will create a new virtual environment with the same libraries that I used:

```bash
conda env create -f my_environment.yml
```
